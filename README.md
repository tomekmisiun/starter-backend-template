# FastAPI Production Foundation

AI-ready **FastAPI** production foundation for SaaS/API projects with auth,
PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, CI/CD, observability, and agent workflow rules.
Multi-tenant hooks, background workers, file uploads, and webhooks included.
Use it as a **reusable foundation** — not as a finished SaaS platform or
enterprise-grade product.

**Status (June 2026):** ROADMAP **P0**, **P1**, and **P2** are complete on `main`.
**P3** and open items in `TECH_DEBT.md` are optional future work. See
[`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for verified capabilities.

## What this is

| | |
|---|---|
| **Is** | A testable API foundation with JWT auth, users, audit logs, Alembic migrations, Redis-backed workers, S3-compatible uploads, webhook idempotency, metrics/logging, deployment scripts, and policy-guarded CI |
| **Is not** | Billing, invites, org membership, managed hosting, or provider-specific production wiring — those belong in your fork |

Clone → configure → extend. Start with [`docs/template-onboarding.md`](docs/template-onboarding.md).

---

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.13+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker, Docker Compose, Make.

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # set a strong SECRET_KEY
make bootstrap          # compose up, migrate, seed, smoke test
make validate           # ruff + pytest (85% coverage floor)
```

|----------|-----|
| API (local) | http://localhost:8000 |
| OpenAPI / Swagger | http://localhost:8000/docs |

Default dev login (after seed): `admin@example.local` / `devpassword123` — change before shared environments. Details: [`app/seed_dev_data.py`](app/seed_dev_data.py).

## What your fork must still configure

The template ships patterns and runbooks, not a live production environment. Each downstream project still chooses and wires:

| Area | You provide |
|------|-------------|
| **Hosting** | Kubernetes, PaaS, VM, or other runtime target |
| **Secrets** | Secret manager, rotation, and GitHub Environment secrets |
| **Data stores** | Managed PostgreSQL, HA Redis, and object storage |
| **Backups** | Provider, RPO/RTO, and PITR policy (scripts exist; PITR is provider-specific) |
| **Malware scanning** | Concrete scanner URL (production validator requires one) |
| **Alerting** | PagerDuty, Slack, or other on-call routing (local Alertmanager is an example) |
| **Tracing** | Sentry, OpenTelemetry, or both beyond the optional Sentry hook |
| **API clients** | Migration from deprecated unversioned routes to `/api/v1` |
| **Product policy** | Registration, roles, billing, and tenant lifecycle for your domain |

---

## Tracking & roadmap

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`PROJECT_STATUS.md`](PROJECT_STATUS.md) | **Verified** implemented capabilities only |
| [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) | Prioritized planned work (P3 next) |
| [`TECH_DEBT.md`](TECH_DEBT.md) | Known debt register |

**License:** see repository license file. **Contributing:** feature branches + PR; run `make validate` before merge.
