# Project Status

Verified implementation state of **FastAPI Production Foundation** — an
AI-ready, production-oriented FastAPI foundation for SaaS/API projects.
Planned work: `ROADMAP.md`. Known issues: `TECH_DEBT.md`.

Do not treat this file as a roadmap or debt register.

## Overview

Reusable, **AI-ready** FastAPI production foundation for SaaS/API projects — a
testable foundation, not a finished multi-tenant SaaS platform or
enterprise-grade product.

**Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible
storage, Docker Compose, pytest, Ruff, uv, GitHub Actions.

**Test baseline (verified):** 374 pytest tests, ~88% line coverage, 85%
coverage floor enforced in CI and `make validate`.

**Production readiness (June 2026):**

- **P0 blockers closed** — all ten ROADMAP P0 tasks (#1–#10) are implemented,
  tested, and merged to `main` (PRs #45–#54).
- **P1 adoption hardening closed** — all twelve ROADMAP P1 tasks (#11–#22) are
  implemented, tested, and merged to `main` (PRs #56–#67).
- **P2 scale and maintainability closed** — all fourteen ROADMAP P2 tasks
  (#23–#36) are implemented, tested, and merged to `main` (PRs #69–#82).
- **Template scope unchanged** — not a fully configured production environment;
  forks still choose hosting, secrets, backups, scanners, and product policies.
- **Next engineering priority** — ROADMAP **P3** (enterprise-scale optional
  improvements). See `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Template freeze (June 2026)** — suitable as a cloneable, AI-ready foundation;
  see `TEMPLATE_FREEZE_CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/ai-workflows.md`.

**Architecture:**

- API routes: `app/api/routes`
- API dependencies: `app/api/dependencies`
- Business logic: `app/services`
- Models: `app/models`
- Schemas: `app/schemas`
- Database session: `app/db/session.py`
- Core config/security/infra: `app/core`
- Migrations: `alembic/versions` (12 revisions)
- Tests: `tests/` (54 modules)

**Documentation and rules:**

- `README.md` — landing page, quick start, doc navigation
- `docs/` — deployment, security, workers, tenancy, backups, load testing
- `.ai-rules/` — binding AI/project rules (source of truth for agent behavior)
- `docs/ai-workflows.md` — how `.ai-rules/`, `agents/`, and `.commands/` fit together
- `agents/`, `.commands/` — optional review personas and copy-paste prompts
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — thin wrappers pointing to `.ai-rules`
- `TEMPLATE_FREEZE_CHECKLIST.md` — template reuse and validation checklist

## Verified Capabilities

### Application core

- FastAPI bootstrap with versioned API (`/api/v1`) and deprecated legacy
  unversioned routes gated by `LEGACY_ROUTES_ENABLED` (default off in
  production; policy in `docs/legacy-route-deprecation.md`)
- Centralized error envelope for HTTP, validation, auth, not-found, rate-limit,
  and domain errors raised from services
- Request ID middleware (`X-Request-ID`, `X-Process-Time`) with structured
  logging (`text`/`json`), sensitive-field redaction, and worker job
  `request_id` correlation
- Production/staging config validation rejecting weak secrets, local/default
  remote service placeholders, unsafe upload/metrics defaults, and missing
  proxy/rate-limit settings in production (`app/core/config.py`)
- Effective DB pool settings logged at API startup (`app/db/pool_config.py`;
  sizing guidance in `docs/production-deployment.md`)
- CORS, trusted hosts, and security headers middleware (env-driven)
- Optional Sentry error tracking (disabled without `SENTRY_DSN`)

### Authentication and sessions

- Registration with `REGISTRATION_POLICY` (`public` | `disabled`)
- Login with bcrypt-hashed passwords and JWT access + refresh tokens (signing
  algorithm from `settings.algorithm`)
- `/auth/me`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`
- Refresh token rotation with Redis-backed `jti` revocation
- Access token invalidation via per-user `token_version` (password reset,
  deactivation, role change)
- Inactive users blocked on login, access, and refresh
- Redis rate limits on `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and password-reset
  request (per-IP with optional trusted forwarded headers; reset also keyed by
  email hash)
- Password reset request/confirm with hashed single-use tokens, SMTP email
  abstraction, worker job delivery, audit log entries, and expired-token
  cleanup maintenance

### Authorization and users

- RBAC roles: `user`, tenant `admin`, `platform_admin` with static permission
  map (`app/core/permissions.py`)
- Tenant `admin` excludes `tenants.*`; `platform_admin` includes tenant
  lifecycle permissions
- Admin `/admin` endpoint; user CRUD, activate/deactivate, self-read/update
- Admin role updates validated against `UserRole` enum (`user`, `admin`,
  `platform_admin`); invalid values return 422
- User listing with keyset cursor pagination (legacy offset fallback), sorting,
  filters, and email search (`search_mode`: prefix default, optional contains
  with pg_trgm)
- Redis-backed user-list cache with tenant-scoped keys and invalidation on writes
- Audit log model, indexes, admin listing, and writes for admin user actions

### Multi-tenancy

- Tenant model with default tenant via `ensure_default_tenant()` / `make seed-tenant`;
  migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6` also idempotently backfills `default` on upgrade (no
  fixed `id=1`)
- `X-Tenant-Slug` resolution for unauthenticated flows; JWT `tenant_id` on
  authenticated requests with optional header cross-check
- Tenant-scoped users (unique `(tenant_id, email)`), audit logs, uploads, cache
  keys, and object key prefixes
- Tenant lifecycle API for `platform_admin`; cross-tenant denial tests

### Files and storage

- Multipart upload and presigned upload/complete/download/delete flows
- Presigned complete returns `verification_status` (`pending` → worker verify);
  download blocked with 409 until verified
- S3-compatible storage abstraction with module-level cached boto3 client (MinIO in
  local Compose)
- Streaming multipart upload for direct uploads (no full in-memory buffer)
- Size limits, content-type allowlist, magic-byte sniffing (PNG/JPEG/PDF)
- Malware scanner integration point (disabled by default in dev; production
  requires enabled scan + HTTP scanner URL; documented in
  `docs/malware-scanning.md`)
- Private object keys under `tenants/{tenant_id}/uploads/{owner_id}/...`

### Webhooks and idempotency

- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/inbound` with timestamped HMAC verification and replay
  window
- Event deduplication on `(provider, event_id)`; payload stored as hash only
- Redis in-flight lock and persisted idempotency response cache

### Background worker

- Redis job queue with main, processing, delayed, and failed queues
- Stale processing-queue reaper before dequeue (visibility timeout configurable)
- Unknown job types routed to failed queue (no silent acknowledge)
- Exponential backoff retries, DLQ metadata, maintenance lock, and tunable
  maintenance/promote loop
- Password-reset email job with Redis completion marker keyed by `job.id`
- Failed-job inspection/requeue CLI (`app/worker_failed_jobs.py`)
- Docker Compose worker service

### Health and metrics

- `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready` (DB + Redis), `/health/db`,
  `/health/redis`
- Prometheus `/metrics` with optional bearer auth (`METRICS_REQUIRE_AUTH`,
  default on in production) and HTTP, dependency, and worker counter
  instrumentation in-process
- Optional Prometheus multiprocess aggregation via `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR`

### Local observability stack

Verified in repo:

- `docker-compose.observability.yml`
- `.env.observability.example` (copy to `.env.observability` for local Grafana auth)
- Prometheus (`observability/prometheus/`) with scrape config and alert rules
- Loki, Promtail (compose service discovery for the `api` container), Alertmanager
- Grafana with Loki and Prometheus datasource provisioning
- Provisioned `FastAPI Overview` dashboard under `observability/grafana/dashboards`

Local Alertmanager uses a no-op receiver stub; see `observability/alertmanager/README.md`.

### Docker and CI/CD

- Multi-stage `Dockerfile` (development/production targets, non-root user)
- Local Compose: api, worker, db, test_db, redis, minio
- Minimal `docker-compose.prod.yml` (api + worker image only)
- CI: pre-commit, pytest with 85% coverage, backup/restore rehearsal,
  load-smoke, Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH gate, dependency review on PRs
- Release workflow (GHCR image on tag), manual deploy workflow with dry-run
  default, promotion scripts, optional migrations and smoke checks
- Dependabot for uv, GitHub Actions, and Docker base image
- Scheduled backup workflow example (requires operator secrets/hooks)

### Operations tooling

- Alembic migrations with Makefile helpers; migration downgrade rehearsal tests
- `scripts/db_backup.sh`, `db_restore_rehearsal.sh` with CI rehearsal
- `perf/load_baseline.py`, load threshold profiles, CI load-smoke job
- `make bootstrap`, `make smoke`, `make validate`, development seed data, and
  `make seed-tenant` for default tenant provisioning
- Runbooks in `docs/` for deployment, secrets, migrations, backups, workers,
  tenant isolation, observability, Redis production contract, and template
  onboarding
