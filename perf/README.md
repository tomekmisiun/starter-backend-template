# Load Baseline

Lightweight local performance smoke for the API template.

## Purpose

`load_baseline.py` measures request latency and throughput for a single HTTP
endpoint. It is intended for local regression checks before larger load-testing
work in downstream projects.

Repeatable thresholds are available through named profiles in
`perf/profiles.json` and the threshold helpers in `perf/thresholds.py`.

## Run

Start the stack first:

```bash
make docker-up
```

Run the baseline against the API service from inside Docker:

```bash
make load-smoke
```

Run threshold-enforced profiles:

```bash
make load-smoke-thresholds
make load-smoke-ready-thresholds
make load-validate
```

Override defaults when needed:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://api:8000 LOAD_REQUESTS=100 LOAD_CONCURRENCY=10 make load-smoke
```

Include database and Redis dependency latency by targeting readiness:

```bash
docker compose run --rm api python perf/load_baseline.py \
  --base-url http://api:8000 \
  --path /health/ready \
  --requests 50 \
  --concurrency 5
```

Use a named profile with threshold enforcement:

```bash
docker compose run --rm api python perf/load_baseline.py \
  --base-url http://api:8000 \
  --profile health-ready \
  --check-thresholds
```

## Result format

The script prints JSON with:

- `target`: requested URL
- `count`: completed requests
- `total_seconds`: wall-clock runtime
- `throughput_rps`: requests per second
- `min_ms`, `max_ms`, `mean_ms`
- `p50_ms`, `p95_ms`, `p99_ms`

When `--check-thresholds` is enabled, the payload also includes:

- `summary`: latency and throughput metrics
- `thresholds`: active threshold values
- `threshold_violations`: list of failed checks
- `passed`: boolean result

Example:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "target": "http://api:8000/health",
    "count": 50,
    "total_seconds": 0.84,
    "throughput_rps": 59.52,
    "min_ms": 1.42,
    "max_ms": 18.77,
    "mean_ms": 4.91,
    "p50_ms": 4.12,
    "p95_ms": 11.36,
    "p99_ms": 18.77
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "max_p95_ms": 500,
    "min_throughput_rps": 10
  },
  "threshold_violations": [],
  "passed": true
}
```

Record results in project notes or CI artifacts when comparing changes over
time. Default profile thresholds are generous for local Docker environments.
Tighten them for your hosting target.

See `docs/load-concurrency-testing.md` for concurrency regression coverage and
the manual GitHub Actions workflow.
