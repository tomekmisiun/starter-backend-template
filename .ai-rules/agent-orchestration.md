# Agent Orchestration

Use this file at the **start of every non-trivial task**. It complements
tool-specific entry points (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and binding rules in other
`.ai-rules/` files.

## 1. Classify the task

| Type | Examples | Load first |
|------|----------|------------|
| Bug fix | Wrong status code, regression | `tdd-and-regression.md`, `context-map.md` |
| Feature | New endpoint, service workflow | `spec-driven-development.md`, `incremental-work.md` |
| Refactor | Rename, extract, no behavior change | `incremental-work.md`, `architecture.md` |
| Security | Auth, uploads, webhooks | `threat-modeling.md`, `security.md` |
| Infra | Docker, CI, Makefile | `docker.md`, `context-map.md` |
| Docs / status | README, ROADMAP, tracking files | `documentation.md`, `review.md` |
| Template clone | New product from this repo | `template-onboarding.md` |
| Roadmap / debt | ROADMAP.md or TECH_DEBT.md item | `planning-and-task-breakdown.md`, `incremental-work.md` |

## 2. Load relevant rules

- Read `.ai-rules/context-map.md` and open the listed files for this task type.
- Read binding rules that apply (architecture, testing, security, git, etc.).
- Optional: use a persona from `agents/` for review-only work (see
  `docs/ai-workflows.md`).

## 3. Define scope

- State the **objective** in one sentence.
- List **in scope** and **out of scope** explicitly.
- Do not expand scope (no drive-by refactors, no unrelated docs, no P3 work
  unless requested).

## 4. List assumptions

- Note defaults you are using (tenant model, env, API version `/api/v1`).
- If blocked on a product decision, ask **one** focused question; otherwise
  proceed with the smallest safe default and document it.

## 5. Pick validation commands

| Change type | Minimum validation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Application code / tests / migrations | `make validate` |
| CI / scripts / policy only | `make policy-guards` and `make validate-ai-workflows` |
| Docs / AI rules only | `make validate-ai-workflows`; run `make validate` if docs claim test counts |
| Docker / Compose | `make validate` if app touched; else build smoke as needed |

## 6. Execute incrementally

Follow `.ai-rules/incremental-work.md` and `.ai-rules/planning-and-task-breakdown.md`.

## 7. Report completion

Every task response MUST include:

- **Files changed** (created / modified)
- **Tests / validation run** (exact commands and pass/fail)
- **Risks** (deployment, security, migration, compatibility)
- **Remaining work** (if any; do not invent follow-ups)

## 8. Git workflow

Follow `.ai-rules/git.md`: no commit/push/merge unless the user explicitly
requests it.
