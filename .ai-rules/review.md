# Pre-Merge Review

Use before opening or merging a PR. Optional deep dives: personas in `agents/`.

## Checklist

### Correctness
- [ ] Behavior matches spec / user request and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty input, not found, inactive user, Redis down)

### Architecture
- [ ] Business logic in `app/services/`; routes thin
- [ ] Services use `DomainError`, not `HTTPException`
- [ ] No new circular imports or layer violations

### Tests
- [ ] New/changed behavior has tests
- [ ] `make validate` passes (or CI equivalent)
- [ ] No new skips without user approval

### Security
- [ ] Auth and permissions checked on new/changed protected routes
- [ ] No secrets in code, docs, or committed env files
- [ ] Production validators considered (`app/core/config.py`)

### Tenancy
- [ ] Queries filter by `tenant_id` where data is tenant-scoped
- [ ] JWT / header tenant cross-check unchanged or improved
- [ ] Cross-tenant denial tests when touching isolation paths

### Database / migrations
- [ ] Model change has Alembic revision (or documented bypass)
- [ ] No destructive migration without guard script approval
- [ ] Indexes/constraints considered for new query patterns

### Performance
- [ ] No unbounded queries (offset deep pages, full table scans without need)
- [ ] Cache invalidation path understood for list mutations

### Observability
- [ ] Errors use standard envelope; no leaked stack traces in production paths
- [ ] Metrics/logging unchanged or intentionally updated

### Docs / status
- [ ] README / docs updated if setup, API, env, or workflows changed
- [ ] `PROJECT_STATUS.md` only for **verified** capabilities
- [ ] `ROADMAP.md` / `TECH_DEBT.md` updated when closing items

### Backward compatibility
- [ ] `/api/v1` contract preserved or breaking change documented
- [ ] Legacy routes unchanged unless explicitly gated

### Deployment risk
- [ ] Migrations required? Redis/S3 new deps? Env vars added to `.env.example`?
