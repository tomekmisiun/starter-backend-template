# CI And Pre-Commit Policy Guards

This document lists checks enforced in CI and pre-commit. Judgment rules that
automation cannot enforce stay in `.ai-rules/`.

**Note:** Guards are exercised locally via `make policy-guards` and pre-commit,
but the first pull request that includes these scripts is the final proof that
they behave correctly against real GitHub base-branch diffs and workflow wiring.

## CI (`scripts/ci/run_policy_guards.sh`)

Run locally with:

```bash
make policy-guards
```

On pull requests, guards compare `origin/<base>...HEAD`. On pushes to `main`,
they compare against the previous commit.

### AI workflow file presence

`scripts/validate-ai-workflows.sh` verifies required agent workflow files
(`.ai-rules/` workflow rules, `agents/`, `.commands/`, `docs/ai-workflows.md`).

Run locally with:

```bash
make validate-ai-workflows
```

Included in `make policy-guards`.

### Model change requires migration

If any file under `app/models/` changes, the PR must add a new file under
`alembic/versions/*.py`.

**Bypass:** update `scripts/ci/allow-no-migration` in the same PR with a
one-line reason (non-schema-only model change), or set `CI_ALLOW_NO_MIGRATION=1`
in a workflow (maintainers only).

### pyproject.toml requires uv.lock

If `pyproject.toml` changes, `uv.lock` must change in the same diff (and vice
versa).

**Bypass:** none. Run `uv lock`.

### Dangerous migration operations

New migrations must not contain:

- `op.drop_column`
- `op.drop_table`
- `op.drop_index`
- `op.execute("DROP` or `op.execute('DROP`

**Bypass:** update `scripts/ci/allow-migration-drops` in the same PR with a
one-line reason, or set `CI_ALLOW_MIGRATION_DROPS=1` in a workflow (maintainers
only).

### CI gate regression

Workflow changes must not weaken:

- pytest coverage floor (`--cov-fail-under=85`)
- Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH blocking (`exit-code: "1"`)
- required `test` job
- `docker-build` dependency on `test`
- dependency review severity gate (`fail-on-severity: high`)

**Bypass:** restore the guard or get explicit maintainer approval with rationale
in the PR description.

### Secrets scan

The `secrets-scan` job runs [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)
on every PR and push to `main`.

## Pre-commit (cheap local checks)

Install hooks once:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Hooks enforce:

- Ruff lint/format fixes
- no committed `.env` files (`.env.example` is allowed)
- private key detection
- staged `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` pairing
- no AI authorship trailers in commit messages (when commit-msg hook installed)

Pre-commit does **not** run pytest, Docker builds, or migrations.

## Policy-only rules (`.ai-rules/`)

Examples that remain human/agent judgment:

- tenant isolation query patterns
- auth and permission boundaries
- API versioning and legacy route policy
- service/route layering
- expand/contract migration strategy
- worker/DLQ semantics beyond pattern matching
- Redis rename compatibility planning
- production runtime safety
- documentation honesty and tracking-file discipline
- git push/merge/force-push without explicit user approval

## Full validation before commit

When changing application code, tests, or migrations:

```bash
make validate
```

This runs Ruff and pytest with the same 85% coverage floor as CI.
